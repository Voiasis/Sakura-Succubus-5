The VPK install may be really slow.

Here's the quickest way to set the game on your Vita:
1. Download the VPK on your PC/Device
2. Extract it like a zip/rar file on a `new folder`
3. Transfer the folder to your Vita
4. Open `VitaShell`, select the folder (without opening it) and press TRIANGLE
5. Scroll down, select `More` and then `Install folder`
6. Confirm the next 2 windows and....done (in seconds)!
7. Last step: copy the `game` folder from the original PC game to `ux0:/app/RNPYSS005/`
